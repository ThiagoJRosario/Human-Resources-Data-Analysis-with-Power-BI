# Human-Resources-Data-Analysis-with-Power-BI

This mini-project serves as an introduction to Human Resources (HR) data analysis using Power BI. Throughout the project, we leverage additional Power BI features such as measure tables and conditional columns to generate insights into the companyâ€™s workforce.

The dashboard is designed to address the following key HR questions:

What is the total number of employees currently in the company?
What is the average years of experience among employees?
What is the total and percentage breakdown of male and female employees?
What is the average monthly salary of employees?
How many employees are there in each job role?
What percentage of employees are available for overtime?
How engaged are employees at work, categorized as Poor, Low, Medium, and High?
Off-dashboard calculation: What is the total and percentage of employees eligible for promotion? (Based on the rule that employees with 5 or more years since their last promotion should be considered for a promotion.)
This project provides critical insights into the workforce, offering the HR department a clear view of employee distribution, experience, salary, engagement levels, and promotion eligibility.
